# LlmSwift
A SwiftUI implementation of [llm.swift](https://github.com/otabuzzman/llm.swift.git). Built just for fun on iPad using Swift Playgrounds 4 to see if it works.

## Build and run
Copy folder `LlmSwift.swiftpm` to iPad and open it in Swift Playgrounds 4. Upload app to TestFlight and install it from there as a __real__ app to run it at maximum performance. Running it in Playground's preview mode is possible in principle, but it is far too slow.
